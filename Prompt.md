# Development Prompts Used

This document contains the key prompts and requirements that guided the development of the Sokoban Game.

## Initial Requirements

### Task 1: Sokoban Clone
- Implement a Sokoban puzzle game with multiple levels
- Player movement with arrow keys
- Box pushing mechanics
- Win condition when all boxes are on targets
- Level progression system

### Task 2: Multi-User Platform
- React frontend with Node.js/Express backend
- MySQL database (later changed to SQLite)
- JWT-based authentication with roles: anonymous, player, admin
- Leaderboard system
- Admin dashboard for puzzle creation

### Task 3: Multiplayer 15-Second Sprint Game
- Multiple players joining same game session
- Players press button (spacebar/click) to increment taps
- Player with most taps in 15 seconds wins
- Synchronized start time across geographic locations
- WebSocket-based real-time communication

## Key Development Prompts

### 1. Database Simplification
**Prompt**: "is there simpler alternatives to store data other than mysql? use the more optimal to this game"

**Decision**: Switched from MySQL to SQLite for simplicity and ease of deployment.


### 2. Admin Dashboard Requirements
**Prompt**: "Provide a simple puzzle creation form: A <textarea> where admins can input a puzzle layout in JSON format (grid array with walls #, player P, boxes B, goals .). A text input for puzzle name."

**Implementation**: Created JSON-based level creation system with validation.

### 3. Real-time Updates
**Prompt**: "update the leaderboard wheb every player finishes a level"

**Implementation**: Added automatic leaderboard refresh after score saving with notification system.
**Challenge**: Could not refresh scores of the default levels.


### 4. UI Improvements
**Prompt**: "The timer should start only when the game starts and resets after next level is pressed, stopped when the player wins the level."

**Implementation**: Added always-visible timer with proper start/stop logic.


## Technical Implementation Prompts

### Database Schema
- Puzzles table for custom levels
- Scores table for completion tracking

### Real-time Features
- Socket.IO integration for WebSocket communication
- Synchronized countdown timers

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Authentication token management

## Development Challenges Addressed

### 1. CORS Issues
**Problem**: File protocol restrictions when opening HTML directly
**Solution**: Full URL API calls and server CORS configuration

### 2. JSON Parsing Errors
**Problem**: Admin-created levels failing to load
**Solution**: Robust error handling and validation

### 3. Win Condition Logic
**Problem**: Incorrect Sokoban win detection
**Solution**: Proper target tracking and box placement validation

### 4. Real-time Updates
**Problem**: Leaderboard not updating automatically
**Solution**: Event-driven refresh system with notifications

### 5. Level Management
**Problem**: Duplicate levels and broken level buttons
**Solution**: Proper level merging and event handling

## Final Architecture Decisions

### Frontend
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for simplicity
- Responsive design with modern CSS
- Real-time UI updates with notifications
- Keyboard controls for game interaction

### Backend
- Node.js/Express for REST API
- Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- SQLite for data persistence
- JWT for authentication

### Database
- SQLite for ease of deployment
- Proper schema design with foreign keys
- Indexed queries for performance
- Connection pooling and error handling

### Security
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

This prompt-driven development approach ensured that the final product met the requirements while maintaining simplicity and usability.
